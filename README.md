Each day, a random number of customers visit your café. They order drinks, bakery items, or both. You must:

- Take and prepare the order using ingredients from your pantry
- Manage your stock (restock wisely with your earnings)
- Serve promptly to earn higher customer ratings and more tips
- Track profits, costs, and tips per day
- Save your progress anytime

## Features

- 20+ realistic drink & bakery recipes ☕🍪
- Star rating system ⭐ (5-star max)
- Dynamic restocking system after each day
